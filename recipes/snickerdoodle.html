        <p>This easy snickerdoodle recipe that everyone loves is from my great-grandma!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.</li>
                <li>Make cookies: Beat together white sugar, butter, and eggs in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough holds together.</li>
                <li>Mix together white sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl until well combined.</li>
                <li>Form dough into balls (about 2 teaspoons in each ball), then roll in cinnamon-sugar coating. Place dough balls about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack for 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
